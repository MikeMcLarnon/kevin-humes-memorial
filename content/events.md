Please join us as we walk in Kevin's memory and mark two years since his passing. We will be gathering at Fitzwater Station in Phoenixville, PA and walking along the Schuykill River Trail. The walk will start at 11am and we encourage everyone to arrive by 10:30 for check-in. 

Following the walk there will be food and beverages available from Fitzwater Station. We hope everyone can gather afterwards to share memories of Kevin.
