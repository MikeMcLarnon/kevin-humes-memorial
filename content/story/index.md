# Kevin's Story

![kevin](kevin.jpg#floatright 'kevin') 

On May 16th, 2020 Kevin was out with his friends in Atlanta for dinner and drinks. While on his walk home he was innocently targeted and killed in a senseless, random act of gun violence. He was attacked less than a mile from his home. 

Kevin was 35 years young and had so much life in front of him. He relocated to Atlanta in August of 2019 after receiving a promotion with UPS, a company he had worked at for over 15 years. He was never a person to start trouble and always looked to make friends wherever he went. This senseless and cowardice act occurred in a matter of seconds and yet, it will forever impact the people Kevin left behind and loved dearly.

Kevin was fun, genuine, caring and loved by so many people. Despite being hundreds of miles from his family, he talked with them every day. He loved to be out with friends watching sports and listening to live music. He had a playful spirit that came out when he would play with his nieces and nephews teaching them tricks that only uncles can.

It is with endless sorrow that we remember our dearest Kevin. A moment will not pass that could not have been made brighter by his spirit. He will be forever in our hearts as we carry him forward with cherished memories of his life.
