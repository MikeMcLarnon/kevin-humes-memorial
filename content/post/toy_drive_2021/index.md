This holiday season The Kevin Humes Memorial Foundation purchased $500 dollars worth of Lego sets from the CHOP toy drive wish list! Kevin loved the holidays.  He especially loved decorating and gift giving.  Kevin was an avid Lego lover from childhood into adulthood so we thought this would be the perfect gift to give in Kevin’s memory.  This donation directly benefits the children in the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia!
