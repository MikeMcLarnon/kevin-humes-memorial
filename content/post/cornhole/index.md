Kevin’s good friend hosted a cornhole tournament in Kevin’s memory in his past residence of Manayunk, Philadelphia.  Friends gathered for a fun-filled day of remembering good times with Kevin and some friendly competition.  The donations and entry fee for the tournament raised $1,000 dollars for the foundation!  

**Shoutout to the winning team Brandon and Dave**
