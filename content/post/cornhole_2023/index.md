Our 3rd Annual Kevin Humes Memorial Cornhole Tournament was a roaring success!
We are thrilled to announce that our event exceeded all expectations, and we
were able to raise over $3,000 for the Kevin Humes Memorial Foundation. It is all
thanks to the overwhelming generosity and enthusiasm of our community.


A heartfelt THANK YOU to all our incredible donors who made a significant impact
with their contributions. A special thank you to all of those who were able to
make it out for the event! Your presence, energy, and willingness to come
together for a great cause truly warmed our hearts. And of course congrats to Jay
and Bobby for taking the 2023 Baggo Championship title!


Stay tuned for updates on our next steps and how you can continue to support
our mission of making a positive impact in our community in our beloved Kevin’s
name.
