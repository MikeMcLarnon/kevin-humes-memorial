We gathered for the 4th Annual Memorial Walk in honor of our beloved Kevin. With an incredible turnout, friends and family came together to participate in the 5K walk, celebrating what would have been Kevin's 40th birthday while also recognizing the day we lost him.

The atmosphere was filled with unwavering love and support as participants donned matching shirts, shared memories, and walked side by side, embodying the spirit of community that Kevin cherished. 

Thank you to everyone who joined us and made this event a heartfelt tribute to Kevin. Your presence and love brought warmth to the day, allowing us to celebrate his legacy while also acknowledging the sorrow of that fateful day. Together, we keep his spirit alive in our hearts, ensuring he will never be forgotten.
Hereâ€™s to many more walks in his name, honoring both his life and the love he inspired. Until next year!
