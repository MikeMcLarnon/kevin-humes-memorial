On Sunday, May 16 ,2021 -  one year after Kevin’s life was tragically taken from him – friends and family from near and far gathered to walk in Kevin’s memory and in solidarity in seeking Kevin’s justice.  Kevin’s village completed a 5k along the Schuylkill River trail and spent time afterwards with great food and drinks reminiscing about our beloved Kevin.
