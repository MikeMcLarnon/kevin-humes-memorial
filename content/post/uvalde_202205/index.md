After the tragic loss of 21 lives in the Uvalde school shooting, The Kevin Humes Memorial
Foundation made a donation to the Everytown For Gun Safety organization. Our donation
helps the Everytown For Gun Safety organization work to prevent gun violence and save
lives by:
- Taking on armed extremism
- Pressuring lawmakers to improve our gun laws
- Educating the public about common-sense gun laws and responsible gun ownership
- Mobilizing grassroots supporters
- Amplifying the voices of survivors of gun violence

Included is the link if you would like to learn ways to further take action against gun
violence. Our hearts are with Uvalde, Texas.
