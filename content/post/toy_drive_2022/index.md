The Kevin Humes Memorial Foundation purchased $2,000 worth of toys for the CHOP Holiday Toy Drive.  The toys were hand delivered by members of Kevin’s family with a special appearance from Santa!  The gifts as well as a monetary donation to The Philadelphia Outward Bound School were made in Kevin’s memory from the funds generated during The 2nd Annual Kevin Humes Cornhole Tournament.
