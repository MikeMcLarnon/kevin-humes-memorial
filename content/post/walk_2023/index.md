On May 20, 2023, Kevin’ village gathered to commemorate 3 years since Kevin’s death and what would have been Kevin’s 39th birthday.  On this particularly hard day, we were reminded of the good in the world as people carved time out of their day to walk together in Kevin’s memory and show support for seeking justice on his behalf.  After the walk, Kevin’s village spent time remembering all the things that made him so unique and special to this world.
